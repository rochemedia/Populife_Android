<center><h2>Why can't the APP open the lock?</h2></center>
<br>
The following situations can cause the APP to be disabled to unlock:
<ol>
    <li>The Bluetooth key is frozen or deleted</li>
    <li>The Bluetooth key expires</li>
    <li>Bluetooth is not working properly</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
For points 1 and 2, you can contact the administrator of the lock to unfreeze or resend the Bluetooth key. If it is the third case, please turn off the APP and phone Bluetooth and then turn it back on.
