<center><h2>How to use smart locks and the APP?</h2></center>
<br>
Before the new lock is used, it needs to be added through this APP. The process of adding is to initialize the lock. After the adding is successful, the current account becomes the administrator of the lock, and the lock can no longer be added by other accounts unless the administrator deletes the lock in the APP.
<br>
<br>
The APP implements the following functions of the lock:
<br>
1. Add and delete lock
<br>
2. Share the Bluetooth key and password to others so that they can unlock
<br>
3. Management of Bluetooth keys and passwords
<br>
4. View the records of unlocking and locking
<br>
5. Delete a Bluetooth key or password to make it invalid
