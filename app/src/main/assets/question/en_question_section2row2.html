<center><h2>Some locks have a password validity period that can specify the start and end time, while some don't?</h2></center>
<br>
For earlier locks, the password can only specify the length of the validity period, such as 1 year, and the start and end time cannot be specified precisely. Locks of this version has been discontinued. Currently produced locks support the start and end time during generating a password.
