<center><h2>Why does the lock keyboard light up and then darken immediately?</h2></center>
<br>
This is the security mechanism of the lock. When the wrong password is entered 5 times in a row, the lock keyboard will be locked and automatically unlocked after 5 minutes. The lock screen can be unlocked by other unlocking methods such as APP. After the unlocking is successful, the screen is unlocked immediately.
