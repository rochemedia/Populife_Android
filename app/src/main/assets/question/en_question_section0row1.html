<center><h2>How to add a lock?</h2></center>
<br>
For a new lock, touch to light up the lock screen to make the lock addable and then add it on the app.
<br>
For a lock that has already been added, if you want to readd it, you need the original administrator to delete the lock in the APP first, and then add it the same way as adding a new lock. Keep your phone connected to network while adding a lock.
<br>
<br>
If the lock cannot be added, the possible reasons are as follows:
<br>
1. The lock is not near the phone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, APP cannot search and find the lock. In the process of adding the lock, please keep the distance between the phone and the lock within 1 meter.
<br>
2. The lock has already been added by others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the APP can search and find the lock, but the lock is not in the addable mode, and the + sign will not appear after the lock name on APP. Please add this lock after the original administrator APP deletes it.
<br>
3. The adding method is wrong
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a lock, you must touch and light up the lock screen to make the lock turn into addable state. When the + sign appears after the lock name on APP, click the + sign to add the lock.
